# Signal-Noise stimuli
These are stimuli with short NatGeo clips ([previews here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l2ncpx3nfp9gzau/AAB_tUb2cBm-5W9fqVqfyh9ba?dl=0)). I only have data for 2 sessions as of now. Each session has a single repeat of 6 movies of 15 mins each, interleaved with two shorter movies of 3 mins, that are repeated between every long movie, as follows:

## Differentiation wrt depth for SN stimuli

Gabors and flashes have a low differentiation compared to the rest. Differentiation increases gradually from TH to VISal, then fluctuates. This increase with depth happens up to a larger depth compared to the touch of evil sessions.

## Differentiation wrt depth for ToE stimuli (new files)

## Df in Will's dataset (ToE)

Note that the peak at VISl that I showed in an earlier analysis is gone. Back then I was filtering units with an SNR > 3, but here I include all units (to make the analysis comparable to Will's earlier analysis).

## Correlation between SD and ND

## Correlations across areas
Looking at raw differentiation traces, it seems like there are reasonably strong correlations across areas. If correlations are high (especially between visual and hippocampal areas, for instance), it would indicate that some other process is driving the activity in a global manner, and not as a response to stimuli. Below I show the correlations for all pairs of areas, during just spontaneous activity, and for all activity, for two sessions.
